  	<h2 class="w3-center w3-animate-right">Problems</h2>
		 <p class="w3-center w3-animate-left">While trying to use the map(), Jesse spent a couple of minutes trying to figure out why myArray.map(DoStuff(x)) was not working..</p>
		 <p class="w3-center w3-animate-left">This was solved by a litte bit of tweaking and w3. The problem was simply that no parameters or parathenses were needed when calling the function.</p>
     <p class="w3-center w3-animate-left">There was also a problem regarding that the output of the javascript would be all written on 1 line even though it was told to writeln. </p>
		 <p class="w3-center w3-animate-left">This problem is stil not fixed...</p>
