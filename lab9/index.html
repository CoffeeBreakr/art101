		<h2 class="w3-center w3-animate-right">Challenges</h2>
		 <p class="w3-center w3-animate-left">Work with a partner using JavaScript to edit elements inside the html without actually editing it..</p>

  	<h2 class="w3-center w3-animate-right">Problems</h2>
		 <p class="w3-center w3-animate-left">>We have never really done anything such as grabbing
			 the elements from an html to javascript, therefore it took a bit of searching and
			 understanding to figure out what to do. Another problem was when Jesse was trying to set thead
		   css attributes of one of the elements in js but it did not work. This was easily fixed when we found
		   that the new1El was using the same p as the one in the actual css file. This meant that the actual class
		   file would overwrite the css change in the js.</p>

		<h2 class="w3-center w3-animate-right">Results</h2>
		 <p class="w3-center w3-animate-left">> As shown below, the div 'output' should show an initial text in black,
			  an appended text in with a bigger size in tan color, and another appended text with a smaller size in blue color. </p>


		<div id= 'output'>
		<p3>Is there anything here?</p3>
