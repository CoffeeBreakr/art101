		<br>Senior AGPM</p>

		<p>This is Jesse Park. He is a student in UCSC who majors in Arts/Games & Playable Media.
		<br>He is Korean American, but is not able to speak it fluently as he spent most of his life in California.
		<br>He is also an aspiring artist and game dev. He hopes that one day, he would be able to create art
		<br>and a big rad game about rocket wielding giraffes.</p>
