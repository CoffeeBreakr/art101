		<h2 class="w3-center w3-animate-right">Challenges</h2>
		 <p class="w3-center w3-animate-left">Work with a partner, make a js that takes input and sorts it and outputs back</p>

  	<h2 class="w3-center w3-animate-right">Problems</h2>
		 <p class="w3-center w3-animate-left"> There was a minor problem where the sort function did not work at all. This was because the sort function itself
		  was not actually closed (missing a "}"). There was also a problem where the button itself would be called before we would click it. This was fixed
			by since the button's parameter directly called the function itself instead of doing a callback.</p>

		<h2 class="w3-center w3-animate-right">Results</h2>
		 <p class="w3-center w3-animate-left">As shown below in below with the button</p>

		 		<button class="w3-center w3-animate-left" id="btn">Enter your name by clicking here!</button>

		<h2 class="w3-center w3-animate-right">Script Output</h2>
